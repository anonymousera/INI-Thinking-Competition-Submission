ðŸ§  Indian Network for Impact â€“ Thinking Competition (November 2024)
This repository contains my submission for the Thinking Competition organized by the Indian Network for Impact (INI) in November 2024. The competition was designed to test participantsâ€™ abilities to apply structured problem-solving and strategic thinking to pressing social issues.

ðŸ§© About the Challenge
Participants were asked to:

Identify a high-impact cause area using a Weighted Factor Model.

Select the most promising intervention, and explore multiple approaches for implementing it.

Conduct comparative analysis using frameworks like WFM or pros-cons tables.

Narrow the scope of the selected approach for feasibility and focus.

Build a Theory of Change (TOC) for a hypothetical organization tackling the problem.

The task emphasized:

First-principles thinking

Realistic project scoping

Causal reasoning and assumptions

Use of external expert feedback

Rapid but rigorous literature review

My chosen cause area was Large-scale workshops on Building Self-awareness and Mental Resilience, with a focus on peer-led early intervention programs.
