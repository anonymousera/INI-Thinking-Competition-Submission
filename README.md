ðŸ§  **Indian Network for Impact â€“ Thinking Competition (November 2024)**

This repository contains my submission for the Thinking Competition organized by the Indian Network for Impact (INI) in November 2024. The competition was designed to test participantsâ€™ abilities to apply structured problem-solving and strategic thinking to pressing social issues.

ðŸ§© **About the Challenge**
Participants were asked to:

1. _Identify a high-impact cause area_ using a Weighted Factor Model.
2. _Select the most promising intervention_, and explore multiple approaches for implementing it.
3. _Conduct comparative analysis_ using frameworks like WFM or pros-cons tables.
4. _Narrow the scope_ of the selected approach for feasibility and focus.
5. _Build a Theory of Change (TOC)_ for a hypothetical organization tackling the problem.

The task emphasized:

* First-principles thinking
* Realistic project scoping
* Causal reasoning and assumptions
* Use of external expert feedback
* Rapid but rigorous literature review

My chosen cause area was **Large-scale workshops on Building Self-awareness and Mental Resilience**, with a focus on peer-led early intervention programs.
